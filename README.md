# Machine Learning Repository

This repository is used for educational purpose only. I use this repository to learn about machine learning and deep learning.

I will be uploading some of my assignments and projects that I have done in machine learning and deep learning courses. The repository is open source, so feel free to use or modify the code in any way you want.

Please note that the code in this repository is not guaranteed to be correct or optimal. It is just a way for me to learn and practice machine learning and deep learning.

If you have any questions or need any help, feel free to ask. I will be happy to help.

I hope that this repository can be useful for others who are also learning about machine learning and deep learning. ðŸš€âœ¨
